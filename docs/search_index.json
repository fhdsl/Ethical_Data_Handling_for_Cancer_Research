This course is designed to help researchers and investigators to understand the key ethical principles of data management from a privacy, security, usability and discoverability perspective. 1.2 Target Audience This course is intended for researchers (including postdocs and students) with limited to intermediate experience with informatics research. The conceptual material will also be useful for those in management roles who are collecting data and using informatics pipelines. 1.3 Curriculum The course will cover the key underlying principles and concepts in data management. It will also cover data security, data privacy, IRB and data access requests, and the ethics of good data management.

In this chapter we will discuss data management strategies to maintain compliance with these important regulations. There are two kinds of information that we will need to be careful to protect: personal identifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI) Note that these are general definitions and whether something counts as PII or PHI has to be evaluated in a case-by-case basis. 2.1 PII (personal identifiable information) PII (personal identifiable information) are items that would allow you to identify a person. Examples include (but aren’t limited to): - Name - Telephone number - Address - Social security number - Age - Driver’s licenses - Medical record numbers - Full face photographs - IP addresses 2.2 PHI (protected health information) The U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services describes protected health information (PHI) as: …information including demographic data that relates to: the individual’s past, present or future physical or mental health or condition, the provision of health care to the individual, or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to the individual, This includes 18 categories: Patient names Geographical elements (such as a street address, city, county, or zip code) Dates related to the health or identity of individuals (including birthdates, date of admission, date of discharge, date of death, or exact age of a patient older than 89) Telephone numbers Fax numbers Email addresses Social security numbers Medical record numbers Health insurance beneficiary numbers Account numbers Certificate/license numbers Vehicle identifiers Device attributes or serial numbers Digital identifiers, such as website URLs IP addresses Biometric elements, including finger, retinal, and voiceprints Full face photographic images Other identifying numbers or codes 2.3 What genomic data is protected? So what does this mean for the data you handle? A not comprehensive list of identifiable and protected information: Clinical information in metadata Genomic sequences Whole genome sequences Exome Whole transcriptome Single nucleotide polymorphisms Geneology information What is not protected and generally is safe: Summarized cohort data Data in which individuals have been aggregated together is generally safe. For example, a file that includes an average age calculated across all individuals or a large subset would generally be considered safe. However, this may not always be the case with individuals with very rare conditions. 2.4 How to ensure the privacy of this information Your institution will have guidance regarding how to keep this information private and protected but in general there are 4 main strategies we will summarize here: As few eyes as possible The protected data is seen by the smallest number of individuals possible, all of whom have been properly trained and certified to handle the data. Make sure the data is stored in a place that only these few people who are allowed have access to it. If you aren’t sure who has access to a place – don’t put the data there! Aggressively de-identify the shared data Before results or data are shared or published, it is aggressively de-identified. We will talk more about what this is in the next chapter. If data has been summarized over the cohort and there are no identifiers then it is probably safe to share. Consider a data use agreement Data use agreements (DUA) are not typically required for HIPAA compliance when sharing de-identified data. However, if you are unsure if your data still meets compliance requirements, you have other ethical concerns about sharing your data (which we will discuss in later chapters), consider a using an agreement. Finally if you need to share data that is not fully de-identified, than a data use agreement is required. Data use agreements essential restrict who can access and use the data that you might share, as well as what they may do with the data. Importantly this needs to be agreed upon by an IRB and consented to by the research participants in some manner (more on this to come) before it is in use. See here and here for more information about when you might need a Data use agreement. Note that your particular situation and institute may have slightly different rules or restrictions. See here for an example DUA template from the Harvard Catalyst. Be sure to follow the attribution guidelines outlined in the link if you adapt the template for your use. Err on the side of caution! If in doubt if something counts as PHI or PII, consider reaching out to an office at your institute that can help, such as possibly an Internal Review Board (IRB), a research administration office, or a HIPAA compliance office. If you plan to share your data somewhere and you are unsure whether a database or repository is secure and HIPAA compliant, ask those who manage that database or repository! 2.5 How is HIPAA enforced? The Office for Civil Right (OCR) of the United States Department of Health and Human Services is in charge of enforcing HIPAA compliance. If you feel that someone is using or sharing data that is in violation of HIPAA compliance, you can file a complaint online using the OCR compliant portal. Typically you should see if you can get the violation to be resolved through local means by contacting research administrators or management. However, you could submit to the OCR. Note that complaints should be filed within 180 days of the violation. If the OCR determines that a covered entity (the individuals or institutes who are required to follow HIPAA compliance regulations), then the OCR will follow up to ensure that the entity complies, takes corrective action, or agrees to a settlement. If compliance is not resolved, than the covered entity may have to pay fines. Currently if an individual is not aware of a violation the fine can be quite small, but if it is a repeated issue of willful neglect, they can be fined on the order of $50,000! If the entity committed the violation for malicious reasons for personal gain, they can face much higher fines, up to $250,000 and may face jail time of up to 10 years (eLearning 2018). 2.5.1 Common Violations Common violations of HIPAA taken from eLearning (2018) are: A lack of encryption If your email or data transfer is intercepted it is important to keep your data safe! We will talk more about how to do this in the next chapter. Computer hacking or phishing If your computer gets hacked by hackers through a phishing email or otherwise, they could sell the data to third party organizations who could profit off of the information. The data security practices that we will describe in the next chapter will help avoid this. Unauthorized Access Allowing or accidentally allowing fellow lab mates who are not authorized to access the data is a violation of HIPAA. Generally this does not result in harm, but occasionally this can result in other neglectful or malicious practice that result in larger disclosures of PHI. Furthermore leaving your laptop open to PHI data in public or even at home can pose a risk from people who walk by. Loss or Theft of Devices If your laptop are external storage device is stolen, data files with PHI can easily be obtained by whoever finds them next. Again the measures in the next chapter will help to avoid this potential issue. Improper Disposal of data or devices Sometimes there are remnants of your data still on your device! Unsecured access to data Accessing your data form an unsecured WIFI network can also make the data vulnerable. See here for more information about HIPAA and research. In the next chapter, we will talk about measures that you can do to avoid these violations.

Data security involves protecting your data from human error, as well as from cybercriminals. Precious data needs to be protected from being corrupted (rendered unusable), being deleted, being misused, and being leaked to the public when the data is sensitive or private (as is the case with much of our clinical data)(“What Is Data Security? Data Security Definition and Overview” n.d.). 3.1 Data Security Strategies There a several major strategies to achieve data security. We will cover the following 4 major categories, in part according to “What Is Data Security? Data Security Definition and Overview” (n.d.). 3.2 Data access 3.2.1 Authentication Authentication is the process of verifying identification. This goes both ways when a user attempts to use a server. Servers will check that a user (client) is who they claim to be and that they are authorized to access the information on the server. The user’s computer (client) will also check that the server is what it claims to be. Typically users will use a user name and password for the server to confirm identity, however your computer often checks a certificate from the server to confirm it’s identity (“Understanding Authentication, Authorization, and Encryption : TechWeb : Boston University” n.d.). 3.2.2 Authorization Authorization is the process of verifying that a client has permission to access a file or computing resource in a particular way, which leads us to permissions (“Understanding Authentication, Authorization, and Encryption : TechWeb : Boston University” n.d.). 3.2.3 Permissions If you use the command line, you may have noticed that files are sometimes listed with letters like so: These letters indicate the users ability to perform tasks for each file called file system permissions. In unix or unix-like systems, there are three types of users: Owner (sometimes called user) - This is the person that created the file by default Group users - groups can be created to more easily give the correct permissions for various files for a similar group of users. Other users - This is any other user who might come into access with the file There are generally 3 types of permissions: read (r) - the user can read the contents of the file, or the user can just read file names in the case of a directory (or folder) write (w) - the user can modify the file, or the user can create or delete files in the case of a directory (or folder) execute (x) - the user can execute a file - this allows the operating system to run the file, for example a user could run a script, or the user can search among files in the case of a directory (or folder) Values for permission follow a standard form: The first value indicates information about the file type, if it is a regular file it is often just a -. This does not indicate any information about permissions. If it is a link to a file located somewhere else it is indicated with an l. The next 3 values indicate what the owner of the file can do. They are always listed in the order of read, write, and execute permissions. The next three values indicate what the group members can do (again with the order listed above). the final three values indicate what other users can do (again with the order listed above) (“File-System Permissions” 2021). Sometimes you will see an @ or + symbol at the end, which indicates that there are additional attributes about the file that you can use a command like ls-al@ filename to get the information, or additional security information about the file, which you can obtain using a command like ls -le filename or getfacl filename. The command that you should use depends on your operating system. In the above image we see -rwxr-xr-x for one of the files. The - at the beginning indicates that the file is a regular file, the next 3 values of rwx indicate that the owner has read, write, and execute permissions, the r-x indicates that the group has read and execute permissions but not write, and the last r-x indicate that the other users also have only read and execute permissions. There are commands to modify file permissions. If you are using a Unix-like system, you can modify permissions with the chmod command, which stands for “change mode” (“Manage File Permissions on Unix-Like Systems” n.d.). 3.2.3.1 The principal of least privilege The principal of least privilege (PoLP) also called the principal of least authority specifies that users should only have access to the data or resources necessary to complete a task. If someone does not need access to perform work, they should not be given access. Furthermore, if someone is given access to perform a task and they complete that task, access should then be removed from that person. Additionally, if someone only needs to read a file, then they do not need access to modify the file. In this case a user can have read permissions but not write permissions. Ultimately this type of management leads to the least number of users having access to read or alter protected or sensitive data at a given time (“Least Privilege CISA” n.d.; “Wikipedia: Principle of Least Privilege” 2021). As an example of this in practice: If a postdoc is working on a project with sensitive data, and the PI does not need to see the raw data to collaborate on the project, then the PI should not have access to the data. 3.2.4 WiFi Make sure you also only access secure WiFi networks. One way to ensure this is is to avoid using public WiFi networks. If you must use a public WiFi network, consider using a virtual private network (VPN) for added security. Here is an article about different VPN options (Gilbertson 2021). 3.2.5 Passwords Some people suggest using sentences that are easy for you to remember, you could consider a line of lyrics from song or poem that you like, or maybe a movie. Modify part of it to include symbols and numbers (“Guidelines for Strong Passwords · Information Technology Services · Lafayette College” n.d.). Don’t share your password and keep it safe! If you have a Mac, you could consider storing it in your Keychain, alternatively if you have a different type of computer or don’t like the Mac Keychain, consider Dashlane or other password manger services. Luckily both of these options do not come at any extra cost and can be helpful for storing all the passwords we use regularly safely. These are especially good options if your password is difficult for you to remember. 3.2.6 Cached data (maybe need to move - was going to be stale access) In addition to storing data where you might expect, your computer also sometimes stores your data temporarily using something called a [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing) (“Cache (Computing)” 2022). A cache is basically a small storage of your recent use of data. This allows you to access the data that you have been using more quickly next time you want to do something with it. This process is used by the computer processor or CPU called a CPU cache, as well as software, which we will call a software cache. If you are working with data stored on your local computer, then a subset of short-term memory will be used for the cache, rather than requiring the user to access the data from where it is typically stored much further away in long-term memory. This is more efficient because it is located closer to processor and thus allows for requests on that data to happen faster (“Memory Caching” n.d.). This general process is also used for accessing data on servers or websites. For servers, a cache is often stored on the server side, while often for websites, a cache is stored locally on the user’s computer in the long-term memory so that when users access the site again, access will be faster. Web browser caches can store your browsing history, cookies (a unique ID for the website to identify the user), as well as sensitive data. Although this makes your work faster, caching poses some security risk. They provide additional locations where hackers could access your sensitive data. Furthermore, the data in caches are often not encrypted, making such data more vulnerable. One way to avoid the security risk associated with your cached data, is clearing your caches (“What Is a Cache? UpGuard” n.d.). In the case of a CPU or software cache, this can be important in case your laptop gets stolen, or if you decide to sell your laptop. The easiest way to clear such a cache is to simply shutdown your computer. If you have taken our computing course, you will learn that data stored in short-term memory (like RAM) requires electricity, and it will disappear when your computer is no longer connected to power (“What Is a Cache? UpGuard” n.d.). Note that it can take a few minutes for such memory to disappear. See here for instructions on how to clear browser caches. It’s a good idea to clear your browser cache relatively often, and possibly more often if you access sensitive data on your computer regularly. 3.2.7 External drives There are a few major reasons why external drives, especially flash and USB drives (also called thumb drives) pose a security risk. they are small and especially portable and thus easily taken or lost often these drives can contain malware that gets installed on your computer when you plug it into your computer the memory sometimes fails and gets damaged or corrupted There are several strategies you can take to avoid these issues, if you must use such a drive Durken (2021): never use a drive that you find randomly, ideally only use drives you get from a reputable manufacturer, even drives at conferences could pose a security risk use drives that have encryption (either buy drives that already have it, which is recommended or add encryption to your drive) disable AutoRun software which allows drives to automatically be opened. See here for how to do this. Note that this is mostly an issue for Windows computers. remove the drive when not in use (it improves the life of the drive) keep all your software up to date to get important security updates editing files directly on the drive can limit the life span of the drive, instead simply copy paste files back and forth from your computer If you really need to use a drive that is questionable, check out this article for practices to more safely open such a drive. 3.3 Data masking Encryption is actually just one of the more complex methods of a larger concept called data masking for protecting sensitive data. There are other methods for obscuring parts of the data besides the complexity of encryption, such as the following: 3.3.1 De-identification Data de-identification is the process of removing any values that could be personally identifiable. In other words, it is the process of obscuring the identity of the individuals who have data values within a data set. Re-identification is the process of determining the identity of such individuals based on data (“De-Identification” 2022). Typically an ID number is assigned to each individual to allow for re-identification. The key for these ID numbers and the original identifier information should be stored in a safe manner with a limited number of individuals with access. The ID number should not be created by using any identifiable information (for example birthday -15*32 followed by the first digit of Zip code). In some cases people use what is called a cryptographic hash function which is a condensed representation of an individual’s data (including identifiable information) to a standard ID length. Such functions are HIPAA compliant under special circumstances, such as restricted access because they are very difficult to decipher. These hash function IDs have an advantage of allowing for the same individual across different datasets to be tracked (but are not intended for re-identification), which can be helpful for longitudinal studies (“HIPAA Privacy Regulations: Other Requirements Relating to Uses and Disclosures of Protected Health Information: Re-Identification - § 164.514(c)” n.d.). See here for additional information about HIPAA de-identification regulations. While somewhat useful for protecting the identity of those included in data, de-identification is not necessarily robust to newer re-identification methods. Thus other security, privacy, and protection methods are necessary. The HIPAA Privacy Rule specifies two methods or standards for de-identification: Safe Harbor and Expert Determination. While it is possible to de-identify your data yourself, unless you are an expert, we suggest that you seek out an expert to help you instead. There are nuances regarding privacy that you may miss without ample experience. 3.3.1.1 Safe harbor This method is the more extreme of the two and results in more loss of data. A list of 18 standard identifiers must be removed from the data. These are the same 18 PHI categories of identifiers that we described in the last chapter, including name, IP addresses, etc (Rights (OCR) 2012). Additional rules are required as well. For example zip codes may remain in the data if they are shortened to the initial 3 digits and meet certain population threshold criteria. Dates can only remain at the year level, with extra protection for individuals over 89 years of age. However other abbreviations, such as name initials are not permitted. 3.3.1.2 Expert Determination This method attempts to preserve more of the original data, and data is removed based on the risk of re-identification. As the name describes, an expert evaluates the risk for re-identification of the various values within the data including what the risk might be with if the data were to be combined with other data sources. Ultimately data is removed until there is only a very small risk of someone being able to re-identify the individuals with data values among the dataset. The expert records what methods they used an the analysis that they did to determine the risk. There is no standardized single way to mitigate risk, but again a set of methods. These typically involve slight modifications to the data called perturbation, coding certain values called generalization or removal of data called suppression. These can occur at the feature level, such as all ages, at the individual level, such as removal of one individual, or at the value level, such as one data value for one individual. An example of perturbation could be the modification of age by up to 5 years. An example of generalization would be that all individuals over a certain age could be given the same age group value. As example of suppression at the feature level, one could remove all names. As example of suppression at the individual level, in some cases there are individuals who are themselves very distinguishable due to some extreme attribute about themselves and may need to be removed due to the uniquely high risk of identification. If there is just one aspect about these individuals, than that value for the individual can be removed instead of removing the individual from the data entirely. 3.3.1.3 Limitations In some cases removing protected information can result in data loss that could impede research initiatives. However, generally the limitations of de-identification are the risks that they pose for re-identification. For Expert Determination, there is no specific degree requirement or training to be considered an “expert”, however typically they are individuals with a statistical background. There is also no specific threshold of what constitutes a very small risk. This is determined by the expert. Additionally, there is no required length of time that a determination expires. It is highly suggested that additional evaluations occur over time as the risks change as technology changes and as the uniqueness of the individuals within the dataset evolves. For example if there are much fewer people over a certain age still living in a sparsely populated area, they could become identifiable. There is also no standard single method to assess re-identification risk. Instead there are a set of methods that follow major principles of risk assessment. They are based on the ability to reproduce the data values for the individual, the availability of identifiable data values from other sources, and the uniqueness or distinguishability of the data values. However, whatever methods are used, the expert is required to document this and make it available to the OCR if they request it. Even safe harbor which is a more stringent method, has privacy limitations. There are other aspects about the data that could be or could become identifiable. For example, if an individual has a very unique occupation (such as state senator) or combination of certain remaining characteristics, they could become identifiable. Another example is if an individual was a very unique clinical case. 3.3.2 Encryption Encryption is one of the most well-known methods for keeping data safe. It is used as a last method in case unauthorized users can access to data, and it is also used to protect data when transferring it. The process involves encoding or scrambling the data in a nonrandom format (we call this form of the data encrypted) that given the right instructions, a computer can reformat into the original form in a process called decryption. The instructions called the key are kept safe like a password and depending on the type of encryption, it can require quite a lot of computational power to decrypt the data. This protects the data because if a cybercriminal accesses the data or if the data is somehow made public when it shouldn’t be, it will not be easily interpreted (“What Is Data Encryption?” 2018). There are different methods for encrypting data. One common method is called asymmetric, which involves two keys, a public key and a private key (“What Is Encryption? Data Encryption Defined” n.d.). This method is also sometimes simply called public key. Users can get access to the public key to allow them to encrypt the data, while the private key remains private and is used to decrypt the data. This method is also called public-key encryption (“What Is Encryption? Data Encryption Defined” n.d.). Symmetric cryptography on the other hand uses one key for encryption and decryption. In systems that use this type of encryption, pairs of users will often be given their own key. The advantage of this system is that decryption is a bit faster, the keys are smaller, and it is generally less expensive to implement. If someone gains access to the key, however they can decrypt data or messages, and encrypt data or messages and appear as if they are the person that owns that key. So often the keys themselves are encrypted (“What Is Encryption? Data Encryption Defined” n.d.). Since symmetric decryption is faster, it is often used for transferring data or for large datasets.Common symmetric algorithms are AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 (Labs n.d.). Asymmetric encryption is regarded to be more secure, common algorithms included RSA and DSA, and several PKCS standards (Labs n.d.). These algorithms involve mathematical operations to encrypt the data. See this video for a simplified explanation and a suggestion for a video series if you want to learn more about how these encryption algorithms work: 3.3.2.1 SSL Socket Layer This is what the s in https is for. This indicates that data from the server is using a form of encryption and that the website server has a special SSL certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority that verified that the server can be trusted. There is actually a lot happening behind the scenes! According to “What Is SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)? What Is an SSL Certificate? DigiCert” (n.d.) this involves the following steps: A web browser (like chrome) connects to a web server (website) that is secured with SSL (it starts with https instead of http). The browser asks the server to identify itself. The Server sends a copy of the SSL certificate and the public key. The browser checks the certificate to make sure that it comes from a trusted certificate authority and that the certificate has not expired or been revoked. The browser also checks that the names on the certificate and the website match. It then sends the server an encrypted session key based on the public key. The server then decrypts the session key using the private key and sends an encrypted acknowledgment to start an encrypted session. The server and browser can now transmit encrypted data back and forth. Note that newer versions of this process are called Transport Layer Security (TLS). 3.3.2.2 SSH Secure Shell SSH is also a process for securely transmitting files from one computer to another using encryption. However, in this case it can be done using a command line interface instead of a browser. SSH also does not involve certificate. https://sectigostore.com/blog/ssh-vs-ssl-exploring-the-similarities-and-differences/ https://www.jscape.com/blog/ssl-vs-ssh-simplified 3.4 Data erasure It turns out that when you delete a file (even after emptying the trash), it isn’t as “deleted” as you might think. This is because when a file is deleted, the data for that file actually stays on the storage hardware, and it’s simply the computer’s ability to find the data that is hindered. However, there is software that can help people recover data on storage hardware. This can be a great security issue, as sensitive data can remain on people’s hardware when they get a new computer or stop using particular data on a server. One method to ensure that the deleted data is really eliminated is to physically destroy the hardware that it was stored on. However, this isn’t always necessary, as there are methods using software. This option is great because the hardware can be reused without allowing future users potential access to your data. As you might imagine, this is the preferred method for erasing data on shared computing resources like servers (Tilly Holland 2020). These methods erase the data by overwriting the data with random digital information (“Data Erasure” 2021). 3.5 Data resiliency If you are working with precious data directly on your laptop, in case something happens to a computer, it’s a good idea to think about storing the data with multiple locations. The traditional 3-2-1 backup rule recommends that you keep at least three copies of your data, two different copies stored on separate formats and at least one additional copy at an offsite location.(Durken 2021) For example, you might think about having one copy on your password protected laptop, one encrypted and zipped copy on your password protected external drive at home, and another encrypted copy on your password protected external drive in your office. However, in the age of cloud computing and servers, this rule needs to be updated a bit. It has been suggested that if you make use of remote computing options, instead the 3 should indicate that there should be 3 additional copies to the original, 2 indicates that there should be copies stored in two different places on a server or two regions in a cloud (where possible), and the 1 indicates that you should have one copy of the data that is closer to where it was originally created just in case something happens with the server or cloud that you are using (Posey 2021). 3.6 Security in workflows 3.7 Data protection tools for healthcare redcap 3.8 Email security Email can also pose a risk for our data. This can be due to the security risks of actually emailing our data to a colleague or issues related to having our computer hacked by someone through phishing emails. 3.8.1 Email Encryption If possible we would suggest that you avoid sharing data through email, and instead share data through other means, such as a shared computing platform, especially if you have data that requires HIPAA compliance and you have identified a platform to work on that is HIPAA compliant. Please see our computing course for more information about this. However we understand that there are situations where you might need to email data. If your data has any PHI or PII, we suggest that you only send such emails using a secure network and using an encrypted email. How do you do this? If you use Outlook, there are options to do so currently under the “Draft” menu, by selecting the “Encrypt” option. Gmail also supports encrypted emails. Be sure to Google how if this course becomes out-of-date. 3.8.2 Phishing You likely have heard from your IT department at your institute about being careful about phishing. If you are working with PII or PHI, then you need to be extra vigilant. Phishing emails are emails in which someone tries to get you to click on a link or to respond with credential information in order to hack your computer or gain access to sensitive data. Spear phishing occurs when someone poses as an individual, often someone who is more senior at the institution (this is specifically called whaling), to gain information from others (“Phishing” 2022). Criminals are getting more sophisticated in their attempts, making it more difficult to avoid. Here are some things to look out for: Be very weary about emails from unrecognized senders! You can look up the sender to verify if the person is who you expect. If the email looks suspicious but still potentially real, you could contact the individual on linked-in or elsewhere to verify if the person actually contacted you. If their email does not match their name this is also extra suspicious. For example, if you get an email signed by George and the email is Peter125@network.org, this could very well be a phishing attempt. Check the senders email. Make sure that the email address from the sender looks like what you recognize. If you know the sender and they send you an email with an unusual email address, be careful. You can send them an email to their typical address to verify if it is really them. For example if your boss Karen, sends you an email from kit345@TSU.edu or titan@hotmail.com and typically her email is karenw3@TSU.edu, you should be suspicious. Watch out for links. Avoid clicking on links in emails as much as possible! If you know that your colleague is sending you a link and you see it right away, that is probably trustworthy, but if your admin sends you a link out of the blue, you should be careful. If you must click a link, first make sure that the link looks like what you would expect. Second, send a follow-up communication using another method (phone, slack, different email address), or email a different colleague that you know works with the individual to make sure the individual actually sent the link instead of a hacker. Make sure that you don’t get the phone number or other information to validate if the individual really sent you the email from the suspicious email itself. An example of these types of phishing methods is if your colleague hasn’t told you that he is sending a Google doc link and you receive an email from him with a link, then do not click it before verifying that the person really intended to send it. Yet another example is if an administrator sends you a link for you to update your password. Typically they will instead have you go to whatever portal you need to go to manually on your own to update your password. Keep in mind that phishing criminals can make the emails look very legitimate! Here is a real example of a such a phishing email from California State University Northridge: From: xxxxx, xxxxx&lt; &gt; Date: Tue, May 25, 2021 at 3:01 PM Subject: Action Required | Returning to Campus Guide for Employees Training Dear Colleague, Our records show that you have not completed the Returning to Campus Guide for Employees Training. This training is required to ensure CSUN is in compliance with California OSHA law which mandates that all employees be trained on COVID safety. Please complete this important safety training video ASAP. If you are having issues accessing the course, let me know. Here’s a shortcut to access the training, (Link has been removed) from this link, you’ll select “Northridge” from the drop down and then sign-in with your CSUN credentials. Then select the “Start” button to view the training. Be especially careful of links from two similar emails. Clone phishing is a sophisticated method in which a legitimate email may be maliciously changed and resent to recipients claiming that there was a necessary change. Be especially careful in such situations where you receive nearly duplicate emails with links and reach out to those who sent it to make sure that a repeated email was really from them (“Phishing” 2022). Be careful about attachments! Similar to links, if you receive an email with an attachment that you do not expect you should be careful and not open them unless you verify by other means that the sender really meant to send you an attachment. Don’t give your credentials in emails! Be careful giving personal information. If someone asks for your credentials or personal information, you should be especially concerned. Generally you will not need to share your password with anyone. Typically administrators will have you log in to whatever platform or system you are working in and proceed from there or they will reset your password. If someone asks for your password or username, it is highly likely a phishing attempt, even if it seems like it is coming from a verified source. An example of this type of phishing is if the chair of your department suddenly (out of context) asks you for your personal phone number. Before sending this information, contact the chair by other means to make sure this request is legitimate. Watch out for urgent situations. Often phishers will create a false urgent situation to trick you into clicking a link or giving information. Here is a real example of a such a phishing email from California State University Northridge: Hello there! My name is Sarah. Your website or a website that your company hosts is infringing on a copyrighted images owned by myself.

References "],["data-sharing.html", "Chapter 4 Data Sharing 4.1 Data sharing is important! 4.2 Data repositories 4.3 Data Submission tips 4.4 Health care data sharing tools", " Chapter 4 Data Sharing In this chapter we will discuss the importance of data sharing, best practices for data sharing, places where you can store your data, as well as methods to share data in contexts in which you might have thought sharing was not possible! 4.1 Data sharing is important! Sharing data is critical for optimizing the advancement of scientific understanding. Now that labs all over the world are producing massive amounts of data, there are many discoveries that can be made by just using this existing data. This is so important, that starting in January, 2023 the NIH will require specific sharing practices for data management and sharing. See the announcement here. Note that many institutes and funding agencies or mechanisms have requirements about how your data can be shared. Typically data sharing of protected data also requires Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval before the study is conducted. Ensure that you are following those requirements before you share your data. There’s so many excellent reasons to put your data in a repository whether or not a journal requires it: Sharing your data… Makes your project more transparent and thus more likely to be trusted and cited. In fact one study found that articles with links to the data used (in a repository) were cited more than articles without such information or other forms of data sharing (Colavizza et al. 2020). Helps your relieve your own workload so your email inbox isn’t loaded by requests you probably don’t have time to respond to. Allows others to gain even more insights from your data which shows funders that your data will be used to its maximum potential. 4.2 Data repositories The best way to share your data is by putting it somewhere that others can download it (and it can be kept private when necessary). There’s many repositories out there that handle this for you. Below are some of the standard repositories for data you should consider. For a longer list of repositories, we also advise consulting this Nature guidance on data repositories. 4.2.1 Genomic Data Repositories National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) For microarray: GEO Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) For RNA-seq: SRA (Sequencing Read Archive) European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) International Nucleotide Sequence Databases—DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) 4.2.2 Imaging data repositories Imaging data resource Cancer imaging archive 4.2.3 Repositories for journal articles For manuscripts or large datasets that are of atypical format, using one of these repositories is a good idea. The journal you submit to may have a recommendation of one over another. If not, you might end up having a preference. CyVerse Data Commons Repository Data Dryad FigShare ZENODO 4.2.4 Small datasets Data sets that are small and atypical format can be published as supplementary files as a part of a manuscript. 4.3 Data Submission tips Uploading a dataset to a data repository is a great step toward sharing your data! But, the dataset uploaded is unclear and unusable it might as well not been uploaded in the first place. Keep in mind that although you may understand the ins and outs of your dataset and project, its likely that others who look at your data will not understand your notation. To make your data truly shared, you need to take the time to make sure it is well-organized and well-described! There are two files you should make sure to include to help describe and organize your data project: A main README file that orients others to what is included in your data. A metadata file that samples that are included, how they are connected, and when appropriate following privacy ethics, describes clinical features. Standards for genomic metadata 4.3.1 Use consistent and clear names Make sure that sample and data IDs used are consistent across the project - make sure to include a metadata file that describes in detail your samples in a way that is clear without any prior knowledge of the project. Sample and data IDs should keep with standard formatting otherwise known in the field. Features names should avoid using genomic coordinates as these may change with new genome versions. 4.3.2 Make your project reproducible Reproducible projects are able to be re-run by others to obtain the same results. The main requirements for a reproducible project are: The data can be freely obtained from a repository (this maybe summarized data for the purposes of data privacy). The code can be freely obtained from GitHub (or another similar repository). The software versions used to obtain the results are made clear by documentation or providing a Docker container. The code and data are well described and organized with a system that is consistent. 4.3.3 Have someone else review your code and data! The best way to find out if your data are useable by others is to have someone else look it over! There are so many little details that go into your data and projects. Those details can easily lead to typos and errors upon data submission and also can lead to confusion when others (or your future self) are attempting to use that data.The best way to test if your data project is usable is to have someone else (who has not prepared the data) is able to make sense of it. For more details on how to make data and code reproducible tips, see our Intro to Reproducibility course. 4.4 Health care data sharing tools https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8178732/?report=classic Amazon Comprehend Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) 4.4.1 REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) REDCap is a very widely used browser-based software application for managing surveys and databases. It is very often used for clinical data. In fact, it is so widely used that there is a conference dedicated to it. REDCap allows for multi-institutional work, as well as compliance with HIPAA, 21 CFR Part 11 for data for the FDA, FISMA for government data, HIPAA, and GDPR for data for the European Union. It was developed by a team at Vanderbilt University in 2004. It is not open-source, however it is free to use for non-commercial research (“REDCap” 2022). You can find out more about how to use REDCap at the REDCap website which includes instructional videos and other resources. There are several things to keep in mind when using REDCap from an ethical standpoint. Roles REDCap allows for various roles to be established for users on a project. Thus access to certain data and tasks can be restricted to certain individuals. As described previously, it is a good idea to restrict access to the smallest number of individuals necessary. You can modify these roles using the User Rights menu. This will first show you who has what role on the project and their rights. You can click on an individual role to modify it. These roles should be verified by your institutional review board (IRB) before beginning a study. Changes to roles should also be reviewed by your IRB. Reports Reports that are exported can be customized to only show data that should be shared with the individual that you plan to share with. Please see the section on de-identification to better understand what data you might want to be restrictive about sharing. Again, the way you intend to share your data should be reviewed by your IRB before you begin your study. For example, you might remove the dates from the following report: Auditing REDCap keeps track of all data modifications, as well as data exports or report generations, in addition to keeping track of who performs those actions. This can be helpful for checking what has happened and when, in case anything happens that is unexpected or unintended. This is also great from a reproducibility or transparency standpoint - you have a record of any modifications to the data. This information can be obtained from the logging menu. Keep instruments short If your instruments are too long, this can result in accidentally sharing data that you don’t intend to, simply because you have more data to sift through. This also makes it easier to generate reports only on specific data that you would like to share. Data can be locked You can protect your data from accidentally being modified by locking specific data. Furthermore, at later stages of the project the data can no longer be modified. Security Scott Carey can help with this section maybe Keep in mind that your institution likely has their own guidelines for how to use REDCap should you decide to use it. Also remember to verify what you plan to do with your institutional review board (IRB) before you begin the study.

Data ethics involves the consideration of data collection, maintenance, security, privacy, and sharing, and mindfulness about how our research can ultimately impact (or not impact as the case may be for research that lacks inclusivity and equity) research participants and other individuals. Importantly, we do not yet have established societal norms or protocols for every aspect of medical research, and many topics are still under debate especially when it comes to cutting edge research. However, general principles of ethics can be helpful and involve practices for research integrity, consideration for social justice, data security, and transparency. 5.1.1 Before and after research Data ethics requires thoughtfulness both throughout the planning and research process to produce research that benefits society and does as little harm as possible, as well as mindfulness for what happens after the research is complete and published. Researchers need to consider both how their work will resolve unanswered questions and who the research might help, as well as consider how others might use or misuse their data, code, and results in the future (Lipworth, Mason, and Kerridge 2017; Teoli and Ghassemzadeh 2021). 5.1.2 Considerations before Ethical research should involve consideration of how data should be collected, so that certain individuals are not left out of reaping the benefits of important research. For example, women, non-binary individuals, disabled individuals, and people of certain ethnic backgrounds, and intersections of various demographic factors have been historically left out of clinical trials or when included, their data was inadequately recorded (Clark et al. 2019). For example, clinical trials often have questions about sex or gender with limited binary options (overlooking people without a binary sex and non-binary gendered individuals) resulting in a lack of collection of important information that could impact clinical outcomes, research results, and communication about results (Chen et al. 2019). Beyond this, even basic studies have historically often neglected to evaluate female animal models which can provide a greater understanding of how the research may successfully translate to more individuals. Yet another example is the historical lack of diversity in genomic reference datasets. To learn more about how social injustice, sexism and other societal aspects have influence bioethical and therefore data ethics practices, see Farmer (2004). 5.2 After Considerations While data sharing can result in wonderful opportunities for secondary analysis, we need to also consider some of the harm that could be caused by sharing our data and make sure that we do it mindfully. With more advanced forms of genomic and imaging technology, and increased use of data from our phones we have much more information (including real-time data) about the subjects we are using, and thus the risk to our subject from the consequences of others identifying the subjects in our studies is much higher than it used to be (Byrd et al. 2020). Overall there is a continuum of risk across the various types of data that we as researchers collect. Wile some forms of data, such as that derived from model organisms pose essentially no risk, intermediate forms of data such as summarized counts across a set of human samples pose more risk, while raw data and in particular data from individuals such as whole genome sequencing data, pose great risk for identification (Byrd et al. 2020). Why does it mater that research subjects might be identifiable to others? In some cases open awareness about patients with certain types of cancers or diseases can be useful to allow other researchers and patients to find these individuals to encourage additional research and patient support group participation (especially for rare diseases or conditions). However, such information can put these individuals at risk for difficulty with insurance and employment, as well as at risk for other forms of discrimination. Furthermore, research data often also contains basic information about individuals, such as their address, which can be potentially deleterious for the safety of those individuals. New forms of research data from apps on our phone such as social media data collection, can pose more complicated risks based on data collection about the behaviors of research participants (Seh et al. 2020). Beyond the risk that data breaches pose to research participants, such breaches also cause harm to the research institutes where the breach occurred. Reputations and funding opportunities can be greatly compromised. Why else does data protection matter at the individual level? Manipulated data can result in false research findings, altered treatment plans by physicians, and more Seh et al. (2020). We will discuss what can be done to reduce the risks of research participants and others from your research. 5.3 Data ethics history To have an understanding of current theories about how to best deal with our research ethic conundrums it is helpful to be aware of the history of biomedical research in general. Most regulations of biomedical research stems from historical ill treatment of research participants. This has taken many forms from outright ill intent, to much more well-intended but neglectful research practices often due to a lack of awareness of the potential consequences. This has been especially difficult more recently as our potential to create and share data has dramatically expanded. 5.3.1 Historical incidences: Here are a couple of famous historical examples of medical research that was performed in a harmful manner. These incidences have shaped policy about ethical research, in terms of advocacy for informed consent (more on that in the next section), as well as recognition for the role of social injustice in research. Tuskegee syphilis trial: A study in Tuskegee, Alabama about the outcomes of untreated syphilis in Black males (1932-1972) in which the patients were told they were being treated but were in fact not being treated (McVean 2019). Henrietta Lacks and HeLa Cells: In 1951, a patient named Henrietta Lacks was treated for cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins. Her cancerous cells turned out to be uniquely capable of surviving and reproducing and have been used widely in research for decades for many discoveries. Her family did not receive money from the companies that profited from her cells, and for decades her family was often not asked for consent as doctors and scientists revealed her name and medical records publicly (“Henrietta Lacks: Science Must Right a Historical Wrong” (2020)). See here for additional examples. 5.3.2 Recent incidences: With advances in technology allowing for cheaper and easier production of medical datasets more than ever before, we saw the creation of databanks and other shared data resources. This resulted in new ethical issues. Here are some examples that exemplify more current data ethics issues: Data Misuse for Marketing Commercial use of data is yet another possible use of research data. There is one example in which such a situation may have occurred, although there sources about the incident are conflicting (Kramer 2019). ReMy Health is a data analytics company that processes raw patient prescription and insurance data and provides this data to other companies. It was using data from Surescripts, a prescription and health record data company and providing it in a processed form for Amazon’s PillPack (https://www.pillpack.com/), a prescription delivery service. ReMy Health or one of its customers was accused of providing unauthorized access of prescription and patient health insurance information, which was believed to be for pharmaceutical companies for marketing decisions about what medications to market (Chiruvella and Guddati 2021). Surescripts then decided to revoke access for ReMy health to their data, thus hindering access to PillPack. However, Surescripts who made the allegations against ReMy Health has also had complaints of being threatening toward other companies, so it is a bit unclear exactly what happened (Kramer 2019). However, ultimately this resulted in a difficult situation for patients to receive their prescriptions and illustrates how data breaches or misuse by a single party when the data is utilized by multiple parties can get complicated (Kramer 2019). Data Breaches MyHeritage is a genetic testing company based in Israel that provides ancestry information to customers. In 2018, a security incident occurred in which an unauthorized user somehow acquired access to email address and password hash key for over 92 million users. Although this was a very large data breach in terms of the number of users impacted, they believe that none of the genetic data actually got leaked to this unauthorized user (“MyHeritage Statement About a Cybersecurity Incident” 2018). This incident however highlights the concern that could happen if the cybercriminal had been more successful. Data mistakes and neglect Keith Baggerly is a well-known expert in what he calls “Forensic Bioinformatics”. He evaluates other studies to see if he can reproduce their work. He has in a few cases found some very important mistakes. Often the mistakes have to do with sample mixups or a shift in a table resulting mislabeled rows or columns. Although such simple mistakes seem minor, Keith has shown that this can result in major consequences. One rather well-known example is his evaluation (along with Kevin Coombes and Jing Wang) of several now retracted articles (see here and here) by Anil Potti regarding chemosensitivity of cancer cell lines based on gene expression signatures (K. A. Baggerly and Coombes 2009). First the forensic team discovered simple yet very consequential errors (sample case control labels were swapped) in Potti’s work. This lead to further investigations revealing further mistakes, as well as data falsification in several of Potti’s articles. Ultimately, the clinical trials that were initiated based on Potti’s work were terminated, several of Potti’s articles were retracted, and he was asked to resign from his position. See National Academies of Sciences et al. (2017) for more information about Potti’s case as well as 4 other similar cases. Keith Baggerly points out that simple errors do not need to lead to dramatic consequences and encourages investigators to be transparent in reporting their mistakes as early as possible. A good example of an investigator owning up to a mistake is that of Bob Carpenter, see here due to some “buggy evaluation code” as he states here. While pressures often make us feel a need to be perfect. To err is to be human, and taking responsibility for our research mistakes should become acceptable, common practice, and revered by the research field at large. Keith points out however, that it is currently difficult for researchers to find the time to deeply investigate the work of others and suggests that perhaps scientists at funding agencies could perform such forensic work to ensure the integrity of our scientific findings (K. Baggerly 2018). https://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article/5/10/2177/6028939 https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-statistics/volume-3/issue-4/Deriving-chemosensitivity-from-cell-lines--Forensic-bioinformatics-and-reproducible/10.1214/09-AOAS291.full Data falsification Although the previous example ultimately led to some discoveries of falsification, the majority of the discovery started with findings of simple mistakes. However, there are many other reported cases of researchers falsifying or modifying their data to improve their results. See here for examples of misconduct cases identified by the Office of Research Integrity at the US department of Health and Human Services. https://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~stamatescu/DIDEPG/SEMPE/SEE/see13_35046090.pdf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_misconduct Goodstein, D. 2002. “Scientific Misconduct.” Academe Online; 88(1): https://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~stamatescu/DIDEPG/SEMPE/SEE/see13_35046090.pdf https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08989621003641132 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1745691612460687 Targeted testing for specific research use more comfortable for people then broad consent… Improper Data Reuse for Research A research group at Arizona State University initially collected data from individuals of the Havasupai tribe to study risk for type 2 diabetes in 1989. These samples were then later used for other genetic studies, including studies about “schizophrenia risk, ethnic migration, and population inbreeding” (Garrison 2013). These are topics that were considered taboo by the tribe. The research participants did not feel that they consented to other research outside the scope of diabetes. This was a very informative case, ownership should stay in the communities: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UYVnpzSRXn4yXZaQsoaX1ei8eiBRUTABcCb0EFwG_EE/edit https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5310710/ 5.4 General Ethics Code informed consent etc. (Commissioner 2020) Code of Medical Ethics (1957) - Legal Binding of Patient-Physician Confidentially 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) - protected health information and identifiable health information must not be shared with anyone outside of certain covered entities without consent.

We will discuss some of these briefly. 5.5.1 Consent for Data Reuse One major current ethical issue that we face now, is the consequences of the reuse of shared data. As we have described, there are major benefits of sharing data. It can allow researchers to really maximize their efforts. However, there are also negative potential consequences as well. Furthermore, it is still unclear what is exactly possible with our data, for both good and bad uses, as technology continues to advance. Previous management strategies for informed consent originate from research that predates the large scale data sharing that we now use today. In those cases, informed consent was a bit more straight forward to achieve. Now that data is often reused more often, it is often less obvious how data will be used for research purposes in the future, thus it is less obvious how to inform potential research participants what participation really means. Ideally we want to protect participants and family, while also maximizing the research potential of useful data. So how do we do this? Although ethical guidelines about this type of consent are evolving as research and technology evolve, here are some current methods for consent as described in McKeown et al. (2021). blanket consent - Subjects agree that their data can be used for any purpose that the data holder agrees is reasonable. broad consent - Subjects agree that their data can be used for a set of specified purposes. This is more protective but also restricts some uses of data. dynamic consent - Subjects are asked case-by-case for others to use their data. This requires more burden on both the data managers and also the subjects, as they need to continually decide about providing consent or not. meta consent - Subjects get to choose what type of consent they prefer of the other 3 options. McKeown et al. (2021) suggests that we also need to be mindful of the following: Participants should be educated about the uncertainty of the possible future uses of the data. Participants should be able to withdraw their consent for reasons that have been identified as being reasonable. (This creates many more ethical considerations.) Those managing the data and those using the data behave in a trustworthy manner based on defined data management and use regulations (including protection of of data). Participants should be informed about how ethical decisions about their data are weighed based on the benefit to society vs. the risk to individuals and that this involves uncertainty as well. We would like to suggest that updated information should possibly be provided to participants about changes in awareness of potential data uses and changes in awareness of the potential benefit or lack of benefit of the data to society.

The following categories of factors were identified among the reports: 1) Personal and professional stressors This included statements about stressors encountered at work and personally such as: pressure to produce overworked insufficient time mental health issues overcommitted lack of support stress Organizational climate factors This included statements of factors such as: insufficient mentoring/supervision poor communication/coordination substandard lab procedures lost stolen data Job Insecurities These cases described situations in which a researcher felt hesitant to ask for help due to a perception of job insecurity.
