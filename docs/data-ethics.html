<p>Data ethics involves the consideration of data collection, maintenance, security, privacy, and sharing, and mindfulness about how our research can ultimately impact (or not impact as the case may be for research that lacks inclusivity and equity) research participants and other individuals. Importantly, we do not yet have established societal norms or protocols for every aspect of medical research, and many topics are still under debate especially when it comes to cutting edge research. However, general principles of ethics can be helpful and involve practices for research integrity, consideration for social justice, data security, and transparency.</p>
<div id="before-and-after-research" class="section level3" number="5.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.1</span> Before and after research</h3>
<p>Data ethics requires thoughtfulness <em>both</em> throughout the planning and research process to produce research that benefits society and does as little harm as possible, as well as mindfulness for what happens after the research is complete and published. Researchers need to consider both how their work will resolve unanswered questions and who the research might help, as well as consider how others might use or misuse their data, code, and results in the future <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-lipworth_ethics_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Lipworth, Mason, and Kerridge 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-teoli_informatics_2021" role="doc-biblioref">Teoli and Ghassemzadeh 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="considerations-before" class="section level3" number="5.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.2</span> Considerations before</h3>
<p>Ethical research should involve consideration of how data should be collected, so that certain individuals are not left out of reaping the benefits of important research. For example, women, non-binary individuals, disabled individuals, and people of certain ethnic backgrounds, and intersections of various demographic factors have been historically left out of clinical trials or when included, their data was inadequately recorded <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-clark_increasing_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Clark et al. 2019</a>)</span>. For example, clinical trials often have questions about sex or gender with limited binary options (overlooking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex">people without a binary sex</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender">non-binary gendered</a> individuals) resulting in a lack of collection of important information that could impact clinical outcomes, research results, and communication about results <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-chen_approach_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Chen et al. 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Beyond this, even basic studies have historically often neglected to evaluate female animal models which can provide a greater understanding of how the research may successfully translate to more individuals. Yet another example is the historical lack of diversity in genomic reference datasets. To learn more about how social injustice, sexism and other societal aspects have influence bioethical and therefore data ethics practices, see <span class="citation">Farmer (<a href="#ref-Farmer_2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span>.</p>

<div id="after-considerations" class="section level2" number="5.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> After Considerations</h2>
<p>While data sharing can result in wonderful opportunities for secondary analysis, we need to also consider some of the harm that could be caused by sharing our data and make sure that we do it mindfully. With more advanced forms of genomic and imaging technology, and increased use of data from our phones we have much more information (including real-time data) about the subjects we are using, and thus the risk to our subject from the consequences of others <strong>identifying</strong> the subjects in our studies is much higher than it used to be <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-byrd_responsible_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Byrd et al. 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Overall there is a continuum of risk across the various types of data that we as researchers collect. Wile some forms of data, such as that derived from model organisms pose essentially no risk, intermediate forms of data such as summarized counts across a set of human samples pose more risk, while raw data and in particular data from individuals such as whole genome sequencing data, pose great risk for identification <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-byrd_responsible_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Byrd et al. 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Why does it mater that research subjects might be identifiable to others?</p>
<p>In some cases open awareness about patients with certain types of cancers or diseases can be useful to allow other researchers and patients to find these individuals to encourage additional research and patient support group participation (especially for rare diseases or conditions).</p>
<p>However, such information can put these individuals at risk for difficulty with insurance and employment, as well as at risk for other forms of discrimination. Furthermore, research data often also contains basic information about individuals, such as their address, which can be potentially deleterious for the safety of those individuals. New forms of research data from apps on our phone such as social media data collection, can pose more complicated risks based on data collection about the behaviors of research participants <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-seh_breaches_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Seh et al. 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Beyond the risk that data breaches pose to research participants, such breaches also cause harm to the research institutes where the breach occurred. Reputations and funding opportunities can be greatly compromised.</p>
<p>Why else does data protection matter at the individual level?</p>
<p>If data gets manipulated or corrupted, this can result in false research findings, altered treatment plans by physicians, and more <span class="citation">Seh et al. (<a href="#ref-seh_breaches_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Data ethics history</h2>
<p>To have an understanding of current theories about how to best deal with our research ethic conundrums it is helpful to be aware of the history of biomedical research in general.</p>
<p>Most regulations of biomedical research stem from historical ill treatment of research participants. This has taken many forms from outright ill intent, to much more well-intended but <strong>neglectful</strong> research practices often due to a lack of awareness of the potential consequences. This has been especially difficult more recently as our potential to create and share data has dramatically expanded.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.1</span> Historical incidences:</h3>
<p>Here are a couple of famous historical examples of medical research that were performed in a harmful manner. These incidences have shaped policy about ethical research, in terms of advocacy for informed consent (more on that in the next section), as well as recognition for the role of social injustice in research.</p>

Her cancerous cells turned out to be uniquely capable of surviving and reproducing and have been used widely in research for decades for many discoveries.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.2</span> Recent incidences:</h3>

</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.utmb.edu/research/research-at-utmb/utmb-research-day/keith-baggerly">Keith Baggerly</a> is a well-known expert in what he calls “Forensic Bioinformatics”. He evaluates other studies to see if he can reproduce their work. He has in a few cases found some very important mistakes. Often the mistakes have to do with sample mix-ups, such as a shift in a table resulting mislabeled rows or columns. Although such simple mistakes seem minor, Keith has shown that this can result in major consequences.</p>
<p>One rather well-known example is his evaluation (along with Kevin Coombes and Jing Wang) of several now retracted articles (see <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17057710/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(07)70345-5/fulltext">here</a>) by Anil Potti regarding chemosensitivity of cancer cell lines based on gene expression signatures <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-baggerly_deriving_2009" role="doc-biblioref">K. A. Baggerly and Coombes 2009</a>)</span>. First the forensic team discovered simple yet very consequential errors (sample case control labels were swapped) in Potti’s work. This lead to further investigations revealing further mistakes, as well as data falsification in several of Potti’s articles. Ultimately, the clinical trials that were initiated based on Potti’s work were terminated, several of Potti’s articles were <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2011/01/29/lancet-oncology-retracts-previously-questioned-anil-potti-paper/">retracted</a>, and he was asked to resign from his position. See <span class="citation">National Academies of Sciences et al. (<a href="#ref-national_academies_of_sciences_detailed_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> for more <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK475955/">information</a> about Potti’s case as well as 4 other similar cases.</p>
<p>Keith Baggerly <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06903-2">points out</a> that simple errors do not need to lead to dramatic consequences and encourages investigators to be transparent in reporting their mistakes as early as possible. A good example of an investigator owning up to a mistake is that of Bob Carpenter, see <a href="https://lingpipe-blog.com/2009/09/15/retraction-only-1-precision-at-99-9-recall-for-biocreative-gene-chunks/">here</a> due to some “buggy evaluation code” as he states <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2010/10/21/forensic_bioinf/">here</a>. While pressures often make us feel a need to be perfect. To err is to be human, and taking responsibility for our research mistakes should become acceptable, common practice, and revered by the research field at large.</p>
<p>Keith points out however, that it is currently difficult for researchers to find the time to deeply investigate the work of others and suggests that perhaps scientists at funding agencies could perform such forensic work to ensure the integrity of our scientific findings <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-baggerly_what_2018" role="doc-biblioref">K. Baggerly 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Another interesting example is an investigation by Karl Browman, who is also well-known for his “Forensic Bioinformatics”, work is <a href="https://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article/5/10/2177/6028939">a paper</a> in which Karl and his colleagues evaluated sample mix-ups in a dataset with both genotype and expression data for 500 mice. The data for the mice did not meet similarity expectations across the two types of data for 18% of the mice <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-broman_identification_2015" role="doc-biblioref">Broman et al. 2015</a>)</span>. The authors also created an R package to help correct for such mix-ups. The author’s conclude the manuscript as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is an acceptable error rate in a research study? And what laboratory procedures should be instituted to avoid such errors? There exist procedures to help protect against errors, both for genotypes (e.g., Huijsmans et al. 2007a,b) and for microarrays (Grant et al. 2003; Imbeaud and Auffray 2005; Walter et al. 2010), but they are not always put into practice. However, as the current study indicates, with expression genetic data, one can accommodate a high rate of errors provided that one applies appropriate procedures to detect and correct such errors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This ultimately suggests that where researchers have two compatible types of data that allow for checking for mix-ups, methods to evaluate and correct for such errors could be very beneficial.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Data falsification</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Although the previous example ultimately led to some discoveries of falsification, the majority of the discovery started with findings of simple mistakes. However, there are many other reported cases of researchers falsifying or modifying their data to improve their results. See <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/education/products/RIandImages/misconduct_cases/findings_of_misconduct.pdf">here</a> for examples of misconduct cases identified by the <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/">Office of Research Integrity at the US department of Health and Human Services</a>.</p>

<li><strong>Improper Data Reuse for Research</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This section is largely based on an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5310710/">article</a> by <span class="citation">Garrison (<a href="#ref-garrison_genomic_2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>A research group at Arizona State University (ASU) initially collected DNA data from individuals of the Havasupai Tribe to study risk for type 2 diabetes in 1989. These samples were then later used for other genetic studies, including studies about “schizophrenia risk, ethnic migration, and population inbreeding” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-garrison_genomic_2013" role="doc-biblioref">Garrison 2013</a>)</span>. The Tribe did not want research to be done on these topics, as they could be stigmatizing for certain groups. The research participants did not feel that they consented to other research outside the scope of diabetes and this ultimately led the Tribe to file a lawsuit in 2004 against the researchers and the ASU board of regents. No ruling was made as there was a procedural error leading to the case being dismissed, however a settlement was reached, giving monetary compensation and then return of the genetic samples back to the Tribe. The Tribe also banned all ASU researchers from their reservation.</p>
<p>This case pointed out the challenges of informed consent especially when documents are written in languages other than the native language of the participants. In this case the participants signed informed consent documents written in English that said samples would be used for “behavioral/medical problems”, yet in spoken word, the consent documents may have been described as indicating that the samples were to be used for diabetes specifically.</p>
<p>When the researchers decided to study schizophrenia, they obtained Internal Review Board (IRB) approval based on the consent documents, and no additional conversations happened with the Tribe to ensure that the participants understood and consented to the samples being used for other types of studies.</p>
<p>Another important component of native or tribal populations, is that some tribes consider all Biological materials to be sacred and therefore greater transparency about the details of how materials are to be used and greater opportunity to determine how unused materials should be disposed would be very valuable.</p>
<p>This was a very informative case in terms of pointing out many overlooked concerns in data ownership, particularly of vulnerable populations. These concerns include a lack of consideration about the balance of benefit to researchers and others relative to the potential harm or lack of benefit to the research participants and a lack of clarity about how to properly consent populations.</p>
<p>Due to this case <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-after_2010" role="doc-biblioref"><span>“After <span>Havasupai</span> Litigation, <span>Native</span> <span>Americans</span> Wary of Genetic Research”</span> 2010</a>)</span> and other historical disrespectful, neglectful, or harmful research engagements <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-garrison_genomic_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Garrison et al. 2019</a>)</span>, subsequently many tribes became reluctant to participate in research. As many of these concerns continue, many remain justifiably reluctant. Over time this has more recently resulted in discussions about how research can be more respectful, transparent, and culturally responsive with equity and justice as the priority, with Indigenous, Tribal or Native scholars leading the way <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-garrison_genomic_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Garrison et al. 2019</a>)</span>. However more work is desperately needed to improve both health disparities and justice.</p>
<p>Possible guidelines could include (based on <span class="citation">Garrison et al. (<a href="#ref-garrison_genomic_2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Garrison (<a href="#ref-garrison_genomic_2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>, and the author’s thoughts):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>To better understand the needs and concerns of the populations to be studied, members of those populations and communities should be directly involved in the governance of biological data. This concept is called data sovereignty <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-garrison_genomic_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Garrison et al. 2019</a>)</span>. Population members should help determine how researchers work with and consent individuals. More direct participation of these members in the research or IRB processes itself is also beneficial.</p></li>
<li><p>Where possible biological samples should be physically “owned” by the populations that the come from or at least considered as such, even when samples are taken to a lab for processing. Details about how the samples should be stored or disposed of, should be discussed with the study population.</p></li>
<li><p>Researchers and IRBs should consider not only the health impacts and security of research participants, but also the potential social and community consequences. To better understand these possible consequences, members of the populations studied should again be directly involved in these discussions.</p></li>
<li><p>Researchers and IRBS should consider more about the balance of the possible benefit to researchers and society versus the potential lack of benefit or harm that the research may cause the participants are the communities they come from - research should aim to be more beneficial to those participating. To better understand the needs and possible harmful consequences of research, members of the communities or populations should be involved in discussions.</p></li>
<li><p>Ambiguity about consent should be reduced as much as possible to ensure that information is provided that is as transparent, culturally responsive, and clear to those who are consented.</p></li>
<li><p>Participants may need to be contacted again to ensure that consent remains responsive and transparent.</p></li>
<li><p>More targeted specific data uses may be more comfortable for some populations, and may therefore be worth potential later restriction.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Many research groups have decided to use <strong>Broad Consent</strong> in which only a set of potential future activities are consented to reduce later concerns. However this can still result in discomfort and thus a lack of participation by populations that are concerned about the use of their biological materials. This can ultimately result in even deeper health disparities.</p>
<p>Overall, it is very important that researchers and research institutions continue to discuss and work with members of the populations they wish to study to create more equitable, just, and culturally responsive consent processes.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> General Ethics Code</h2>
<p>Several general concepts for Healthcare ethics, and by extension medical research ethics have been described in several commonly used ways, including the four pillars and the seven guiding principles.</p>
<div id="the-four-pillars-this-discussion-is-from-melvin_medical_2020" class="section level3" number="5.4.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.4.1</span> The <a href="https://educationprojects.co.uk/medical-ethics-ethical-dilemmas-in-healthcare/">four pillars</a> (this discussion is from <span class="citation">Melvin (<a href="#ref-melvin_medical_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>):</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The pillar of beneficence</li>
</ol>
<p>This pillar means that healthcare and its research must support the well-being of the patients. This includes reducing pain and helping to increase their overall quality of life.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The pillar of non-maleficence</li>
</ol>
<p>Harm to patients must be minimized. This includes not causing intentional harm but also minimizing incompetency and accidental harm.
This means for research studies and treatments, only conducting those where benefits outweigh the risks.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The pillar of justice</li>
</ol>
<p>Healthcare must be provided to all equally and equitably regardless of race, gender, sex, socioeconomic class, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, or any other aspect of an individual’s identity.
Equity specifically means that those who are societally disadvantaged should be even further aided.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The pillar of autonomy (self-determination)</li>
</ol>
<p>Patients need to make their own decisions about their health. They should be equipped with all information about their health but then respected and supported in their decision.
This is otherwise includes informed consent <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-commissioner_guide_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Commissioner 2020</a>)</span>, which means before a patient can truly consent, they need to be fully informed of the risks, ins and outs of any procedure, treatment, or research study participation.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.4.2</span> The NIH Clinical Center <a href="https://www.nih.gov/health-information/nih-clinical-research-trials-you/guiding-principles-ethical-research">Seven Principles</a></h3>
<p>This discussion is from <span class="citation"><span>“Guiding <span>Principles</span> for <span>Ethical</span> <span>Research</span>”</span> (<a href="#ref-Principles_2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>1)<strong>Social and clinical value</strong></p>
<p>The value of the study needs to be important enough to justify the discomfort, inconvenience that research participants may experience.</p>
<p>2)<strong>Scientific validity</strong></p>
<p>Studies should be designed so as to effectively gain more understanding about the scientific question in consideration. In other words, the efforts of the research participants should not be wasted on a study that is poorly designed and will not add to scientific understanding.</p>
<p>3)<strong>Fair subject selection</strong>
Participants for studies should be selected based on the scientific question. Groups of people should not be excluded without a good reason. Participants should benefit from the understanding that the study should gain. In other words participants should not accept risk for only the benefit of others.</p>
<p>4)<strong>Favorable risk-benefit ratio</strong></p>
<p>Risks should be minimized, while benefits should be maximized. Risks are not just physical, but can involve mental, financial, social, or other risks.</p>
<p>5)<strong>Independent review</strong></p>
<p>To reduce conflicts of interest influencing the care of research participants, study plans should be reviewed by others who are trained to consider the ethical implications of such studies.</p>
<p>6)<strong>Informed consent</strong></p>
<p>Individuals should voluntarily decide if they wish to participate (where possible - some exceptions include very young children or those who are incapacitated <span class="citation"><span>“Informed Consent”</span> (<a href="#ref-wikipedia_informed_2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span>). Participants should be informed about the risks (and potential uncertainty around those risks). This must be done in a way in which the individual can actually understand the information, for example it should be in a language that the individual understands. The information needs to be accurate and individuals should not feel coerced to participate.</p>
<p>7)<strong>Respect for potential and enrolled subjects</strong></p>
<p>Individuals should be treated with respect for the entirety of the process including:</p>
<ul>
<li>respecting the privacy of their information</li>
<li>respecting their right to change their mind, including providing them any new information about risks or benefits that might cause them to change their mind</li>
<li>respecting their welfare and providing treatment if needed and removing individuals for their welfare if needed</li>
<li>respecting their welfare and their right to knowledge by letting them know what was learned from the research</li>
</ul>

<p>We have already talked about the concept of informed consent. Obtaining consent should also include (based on <span class="citation"><span>“<span>IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY</span> <span>Institutional Review Board</span><span>Recruitment of Research Participants</span>”</span> (<a href="#ref-IRB_Iowa" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> and <span class="citation"><span>“Informed Consent”</span> (<a href="#ref-wikipedia_informed_2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> and the author’s thoughts):</p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals should not feel pressured and should have adequate time to make the decision.</li>
<li>Individuals should not experience undue influence, be coerced or be manipulated - They should not feel pressured by the individual recruiting, such as a boss or someone else of power or by offers in exchange for participation that would sway the decision.</li>
<li>Individuals should not receive a misleading or overstated presentation of the potential benefits of the study.</li>
<li>Individuals should be made aware of the uncertainty associated with risks and benefits</li>
<li>Individuals should have the capacity to understand the risks and benefits (this involves consideration for language barriers, intellectual capacity, emotional capacity, stress, sleep loss and other forms of physical strain)</li>
<li>Individuals should be able to withdraw consent at anytime</li>
<li>Individuals should be respected through-out the process including consideration for the cultural values of the recruited populations</li>

<div id="current-ethical-issues" class="section level2" number="5.7">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.7</span> Current Ethical Issues</h2>
<p>There are several issues that researchers and research participants, and really all individuals engaging in health care face. We will discuss some of these briefly.</p>
<div id="consent-for-data-reuse" class="section level3" number="5.7.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.7.1</span> Consent for Data Reuse</h3>
<p>One major current ethical issue that we face now, is the consequences of the reuse of shared data. As we have described, there are major benefits of sharing data. It can allow researchers to really maximize their efforts. However, there are also negative potential consequences as well. Furthermore, it is still unclear what is exactly possible with our data, for both good and bad uses, as technology continues to advance.</p>
<p>Previous management strategies for informed consent originate from research that predates the large scale data sharing that we now use today. In those cases, informed consent was a bit more straight forward to achieve. Now that data is often reused more often, it is often less obvious how data will be used for research purposes in the future, thus it is less obvious how to inform potential research participants what participation really means. Ideally we want to protect participants and family, while also maximizing the research potential of useful data. So how do we do this?</p>
<p>Although ethical guidelines about this type of consent are evolving as research and technology evolve, here are some current methods for consent as described in <span class="citation">McKeown et al. (<a href="#ref-mckeown_consent_2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>blanket consent</strong> - Subjects agree that their data can be used for any purpose that the data holder agrees is reasonable.</li>
<li><strong>broad consent</strong> - Subjects agree that their data can be used for a set of specified purposes. This is more protective but also restricts some uses of data.</li>
<li><strong>dynamic consent</strong> - Subjects are asked case-by-case for others to use their data. This requires more burden on both the data managers and also the subjects, as they need to continually decide about providing consent or not.</li>
<li><strong>meta consent</strong> - Subjects get to choose what type of consent they prefer of the other 3 options.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="citation">McKeown et al. (<a href="#ref-mckeown_consent_2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> suggests that we also need to be mindful of the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Participants should be educated about the uncertainty of the possible future uses of the data.</li>
<li>Participants should be able to withdraw their consent for reasons that have been identified as being reasonable. (This creates many more ethical considerations.)</li>
<li>Those managing the data and those using the data behave in a trustworthy manner based on defined data management and use regulations (including protection of of data).</li>
<li>Participants should be informed about how ethical decisions about their data are weighed based on the benefit to society vs. the risk to individuals and that this involves uncertainty as well.</li>
</ol>
<p>We would like to suggest that updated information should possibly be provided to participants about changes in awareness of potential data uses and changes in awareness of the potential benefit or lack of benefit of the data to society.</p>

<div id="data-sovereignty" class="section level3" number="5.7.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.7.2</span> Data sovereignty</h3>
<p>Let’s take a slightly deeper dive into what data sovereignty really is.</p>
<p>We have already described it as a concept of ownership of data, that the people who the data comes from determine or at least are highly involved in what happens with that data. This is important in the study of people who have been marginalized and historically mistreated in research or otherwise. However, the term data sovereignty can also be defined more broadly, such as the authority of governments to survey or use data from domestic or foreign sources, a concept that is also of important recent interest <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hummel_data_2021" role="doc-biblioref">Hummel et al. 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053951720982012">review</a> of recent literature by <span class="citation">Hummel et al. (<a href="#ref-hummel_data_2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> indicates that data sovereignty is often defined in <strong>many ways</strong> including the ability, rights, or laws surrounding the control, flow, privacy, security, or use of data. The review also suggests that there are therefore several major ways in which data sovereignty can be realized:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Self-determination - Promoting, honoring, and respecting the interests, values and culture of those that the data comes from (particularly when it comes to indigenous populations) by allowing for their participation in determining what happens with the data and how it is collected.Strategies should be used to ensure that the data is beneficial and responsive to the needs of those that the data comes from, as well as mindful of the potential consequences of their use and collection.</p></li>
<li><p>Technical Consideration - IT architecture to ensure that the data is safe and used as intended.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>3.Transparency - People should know when data is being collected about them and what it is being used for.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Legal Considerations - Some countries or nations have regulations about what can be done with data particularly when it comes to transmission to other nations.</li>
</ol>
<p>The authors of the review <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hummel_data_2021" role="doc-biblioref">Hummel et al. 2021</a>)</span> caution that the inconsistency with which data sovereignty is defined could lead to negative consequences if efforts are not made to define the term when it is used. For example, if someone’s concept of data sovereignty is strictly of a technical definition, then important aspects related to transparency or self-determination may be overlooked. They note that Indigenous data sovereignty or data sovereignty as it pertains to indigenous populations, is more more clearly defined, and could be used as a model for other uses of the term in other contexts.</p>
<p>The meaning of the terminology is likely to evolve over time, however, this indicates the complexity of data handling ethics that we are currently encountering and will continue to encounter.</p>
</div>
<div id="finding-artifacts" class="section level3" number="5.7.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.7.3</span> Finding Artifacts</h3>
<p>In some cases researchers will determine aspects about the potential health or genetic risk of an individual as an artifact of performing other research. This leads to the question of if those individuals should be informed about these findings.</p>
<p>Depending on the nature of the research, the potential for finding incidental findings will vary. The <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/sachrp-committee/recommendations/attachment-f-august-2-2017/index.html">Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Human Research Protections (SACHRP)</a> at the US Department of Health and Human Services <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-protections_ohrp_attachment_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Protections (OHRP) 2017</a>)</span> offers guidelines about this topic. Furthermore, if the research requires FDA regulations, than there is more defined guidance and requirements about incidental findings. Yet, for other forms of research, the determination will occur mostly with the institutional IRB.</p>
<p>Often the first suggested step is to determine how likely the research is to yield any actionable incidental findings. Actionable findings are those where the research subject could actually do something to about the finding to improve their health or reduce the risk of health concerns. However, it can be difficult to determine if such a finding will become actionable in the future, particularly when it comes to collecting genomic data.</p>
<p>To be more mindful of future consequences, researchers could also ask their research participants if they would want to know about incidental findings if they were to become actionable in the future.</p>
