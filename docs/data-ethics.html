<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> What is data ethics?</h2>
<p>Data ethics involves the consideration of data collection, maintenance, security, privacy, and sharing, and mindfulness about how our research can ultimately impact (or not impact as the case may be for research that lacks inclusivity and equity) research participants and other individuals. Importantly, we do not yet have established societal norms or protocols for every aspect of medical research, and many topics are still under debate especially when it comes to cutting edge research. However, general principles of ethics can be helpful and involve practices for research integrity, consideration for social justice, data security, and transparency.</p>
<div id="before-and-after-research" class="section level3" number="5.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.1</span> Before and after research</h3>
<p>Data ethics requires thoughtfulness <em>both</em> throughout the planning and research process to produce research that benefits society and does as little harm as possible, as well as mindfulness for what happens after the research is complete and published. Researchers need to consider both how their work will resolve unanswered questions and who the research might help, as well as consider how others might use or misuse their data, code, and results in the future <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-lipworth_ethics_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Lipworth, Mason, and Kerridge 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-teoli_informatics_2021" role="doc-biblioref">Teoli and Ghassemzadeh 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="considerations-before" class="section level3" number="5.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.2</span> Considerations before</h3>
<p>Ethical research should involve consideration of how data should be collected, so that certain individuals are not left out of reaping the benefits of important research. For example, women, non-binary individuals, disabled individuals, and people of certain ethnic backgrounds, and intersections of various demographic factors have been historically left out of clinical trials or when included, their data was inadequately recorded <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-clark_increasing_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Clark et al. 2019</a>)</span>. For example, clinical trials often have questions about sex or gender with limited binary options (overlooking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex">people without a binary sex</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender">non-binary gendered</a> individuals) resulting in a lack of collection of important information that could impact clinical outcomes, research results, and communication about results <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-chen_approach_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Chen et al. 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Beyond this, even basic studies have historically often neglected to evaluate female animal models which can provide a greater understanding of how the research may successfully translate to more individuals. Yet another example is the historical lack of diversity in genomic reference datasets. To learn more about how social injustice, sexism and other societal aspects have influence bioethical and therefore data ethics practices, see <span class="citation">Farmer (<a href="#ref-Farmer_2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span>.</p>

<div id="after-considerations" class="section level2" number="5.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> After Considerations</h2>
<p>While data sharing can result in wonderful opportunities for secondary analysis, we need to also consider some of the harm that could be caused by sharing our data and make sure that we do it mindfully. With more advanced forms of genomic and imaging technology, and increased use of data from our phones we have much more information (including real-time data) about the subjects we are using, and thus the risk to our subject from the consequences of others <strong>identifying</strong> the subjects in our studies is much higher than it used to be <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-byrd_responsible_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Byrd et al. 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Overall there is a continuum of risk across the various types of data that we as researchers collect. Wile some forms of data, such as that derived from model organisms pose essentially no risk, intermediate forms of data such as summarized counts across a set of human samples pose more risk, while raw data and in particular data from individuals such as whole genome sequencing data, pose great risk for identification <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-byrd_responsible_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Byrd et al. 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Why does it mater that research subjects might be identifiable to others?</p>
<p>In some cases open awareness about patients with certain types of cancers or diseases can be useful to allow other researchers and patients to find these individuals to encourage additional research and patient support group participation (especially for rare diseases or conditions).</p>

Furthermore, research data often also contains basic information about individuals, such as their address, which can be potentially deleterious for the safety of those individuals.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Data ethics history</h2>
<p>To have an understanding of current theories about how to best deal with our research ethic conundrums it is helpful to be aware of the history of biomedical research in general.</p>
<p>Most regulations of biomedical research stems from historical ill treatment of research participants. This has taken many forms from outright ill intent, to much more well-intended but <strong>neglectful</strong> research practices often due to a lack of awareness of the potential consequences. This has been especially difficult more recently as our potential to create and share data has dramatically expanded.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.1</span> Historical incidences:</h3>
<p>Here are a couple of famous historical examples of medical research that was performed in a harmful manner. These incidences have shaped policy about ethical research, in terms of advocacy for informed consent (more on that in the next section), as well as recognition for the role of social injustice in research.</p>

In 1951, a patient named Henrietta Lacks was treated for cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins. Her cancerous cells turned out to be uniquely capable of surviving and reproducing and have been used widely in research for decades for many discoveries. Her family did not receive money from the companies that profited from her cells, and for decades her family was often not asked for consent as doctors and scientists revealed her name and medical records publicly (<span class="citation"><span>“Henrietta <span>Lacks</span>: Science Must Right a Historical Wrong”</span> (<a href="#ref-noauthor_henrietta_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>).</p></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.2</span> Recent incidences:</h3>
<p>With advances in technology allowing for cheaper and easier production of medical datasets more than ever before, we saw the creation of databanks and other shared data resources. This resulted in new ethical issues.</p>

<li>Data Misuse for Marketing</li>

<p>Commercial use of data is yet another possible use of research data.

ReMy Health is a data analytics company that processes raw patient prescription and insurance data and provides this data to other companies. It was using data from <a href="https://surescripts.com/">Surescripts</a>, a prescription and health record data company and providing it in a processed form for Amazon’s PillPack (<a href="https://www.pillpack.com/" class="uri">https://www.pillpack.com/</a>), a prescription delivery service.

Surescripts then decided to revoke access for ReMy health to their data, thus hindering access to PillPack.

However, ultimately this resulted in a difficult situation for patients to receive their prescriptions and illustrates how data breaches or misuse by a single party when the data is utilized by multiple parties can get complicated <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kramer_surescripts_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Kramer 2019</a>)</span>.</p>

In 2018, a security incident occurred in which an unauthorized user somehow acquired access to email address and password hash key for over 92 million users.

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Data mistakes and neglect</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.projecttier.org/fellowships-and-workshops/weekly-webcast-leaders-research-transparency/importance-reproducibility-high-throughput-biology-case-studies-forensic-bioinformatics/">Keith Baggerly</a> is a well-known expert in what he calls “Forensic Bioinformatics”. He evaluates other studies to see if he can reproduce their work. He has in a few cases found some very important mistakes. Often the mistakes have to do with sample mixups or a shift in a table resulting mislabeled rows or columns. Although such simple mistakes seem minor, Keith has shown that this can result in major consequences.</p>
<p>One rather well-known example is his evaluation (along with Kevin Coombes and Jing Wang) of several now retracted articles (see <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17057710/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(07)70345-5/fulltext">here</a>) by Anil Potti regarding chemosensitivity of cancer cell lines based on gene expression signatures <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-baggerly_deriving_2009" role="doc-biblioref">K. A. Baggerly and Coombes 2009</a>)</span>. First the forensic team discovered simple yet very consequential errors (sample case control labels were swapped) in Potti’s work. This lead to further investigations revealing further mistakes, as well as data falsification in several of Potti’s articles. Ultimately, the clinical trials that were initiated based on Potti’s work were terminated, several of Potti’s articles were <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2011/01/29/lancet-oncology-retracts-previously-questioned-anil-potti-paper/">retracted</a>, and he was asked to resign from his position. See <span class="citation">National Academies of Sciences et al. (<a href="#ref-national_academies_of_sciences_detailed_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> for more <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK475955/">information</a> about Potti’s case as well as 4 other similar cases.</p>
<p>Keith Baggerly <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06903-2">points out</a> that simple errors do not need to lead to dramatic consequences and encourages investigators to be transparent in reporting their mistakes as early as possible. A good example of an investigator owning up to a mistake is that of Bob Carpenter, see <a href="https://lingpipe-blog.com/2009/09/15/retraction-only-1-precision-at-99-9-recall-for-biocreative-gene-chunks/">here</a> due to some “buggy evaluation code” as he states <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2010/10/21/forensic_bioinf/">here</a>. While pressures often make us feel a need to be perfect. To err is to be human, and taking responsibility for our research mistakes should become acceptable, common practice, and revered by the research field at large.</p>
<p>Keith points out however, that it is currently difficult for researchers to find the time to deeply investigate the work of others and suggests that perhaps scientists at funding agencies could perform such forensic work to ensure the integrity of our scientific findings <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-baggerly_what_2018" role="doc-biblioref">K.

<div id="current-ethical-issues" class="section level2" number="5.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Current Ethical Issues</h2>
<p>There are several issues that researchers and research participants, and really all individuals engaging in health care face. We will discuss some of these briefly.</p>
<div id="consent-for-data-reuse" class="section level3" number="5.5.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.5.1</span> Consent for Data Reuse</h3>
<p>One major current ethical issue that we face now, is the consequences of the reuse of shared data. As we have described, there are major benefits of sharing data. It can allow researchers to really maximize their efforts. However, there are also negative potential consequences as well. Furthermore, it is still unclear what is exactly possible with our data, for both good and bad uses, as technology continues to advance.</p>
<p>Previous management strategies for informed consent originate from research that predates the large scale data sharing that we now use today. In those cases, informed consent was a bit more straight forward to achieve. Now that data is often reused more often, it is often less obvious how data will be used for research purposes in the future, thus it is less obvious how to inform potential research participants what participation really means. Ideally we want to protect participants and family, while also maximizing the research potential of useful data. So how do we do this?</p>
<p>Although ethical guidelines about this type of consent are evolving as research and technology evolve, here are some current methods for consent as described in <span class="citation">McKeown et al. (<a href="#ref-mckeown_consent_2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>blanket consent - Subjects agree that their data can be used for any purpose that the data holder agrees is reasonable.</li>
<li>broad consent - Subjects agree that their data can be used for a set of specified purposes. This is more protective but also restricts some uses of data.</li>
<li>dynamic consent - Subjects are asked case-by-case for others to use their data. This requires more burden on both the data managers and also the subjects, as they need to continually decide about providing consent or not.</li>
<li>meta consent - Subjects get to choose what type of consent they prefer of the other 3 options.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="citation">McKeown et al. (<a href="#ref-mckeown_consent_2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> suggests that we also need to be mindful of the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Participants should be educated about the uncertainty of the possible future uses of the data.</li>
<li>Participants should be able to withdraw their consent for reasons that have been identified as being reasonable. (This creates many more ethical considerations.)</li>
<li>Those managing the data and those using the data behave in a trustworthy manner based on defined data management and use regulations (including protection of of data).</li>
<li>Participants should be informed about how ethical decisions about their data are weighed based on the benefit to society vs. the risk to individuals and that this involves uncertainty as well.</li>
</ol>
<p>We would like to suggest that updated information should possibly be provided to participants about changes in awareness of potential data uses and changes in awareness of the potential benefit or lack of benefit of the data to society.</p>
