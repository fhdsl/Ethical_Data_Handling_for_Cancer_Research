# About this course {-}

This course is part of a series of courses created for the [Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR)](https://itcr.cancer.gov/) Training Network (ITN).  The ITN is a collaborative effort of researchers around the United States that supports cancer informatics and data science training through resources, technology, and events. This initiative is funded by the following grant:  [National Cancer Institute (NCI)](https://www.cancer.gov/)  UE5 CA254170. Our courses feature tools developed by ITCR Investigators and make it easier for principal investigators, scientists, and analysts to integrate cancer informatics into their workflows.
